1. **Professional User Experience**: No more dead links
2. **Lead Generation**: Email signup on every resource page
3. **Brand Consistency**: Cohesive coming soon experience
4. **SEO Friendly**: Proper page structure and meta tags
5. **Mobile Optimized**: Perfect experience on all devices
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with proper ARIA labels

## Verification

All links now properly route to pages with:
- ✅ Beautiful ComingSoon component

## Future Maintenance

When any resource is ready to go live:
1. Replace the `<ComingSoon />` component with actual content
2. Update the corresponding link in the main resources page
3. Remove the coming soon page file

The system is now fully functional and provides a professional experience for users exploring resources that aren't yet available.
